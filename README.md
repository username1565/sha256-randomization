# sha256-randomization
This is randomization script for standard function Math.random().

Maybe this can give crypto strength for this PRNG.

See more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator

This script can be included in HTML by one string:

<script src="sha256_randomize_Math.Random.js"></script>

to use modified function as old Math.random(), by default.

See example in the source code of https://username1565.github.io/sha256-randomization/index.html

Also see comments in the source code.
